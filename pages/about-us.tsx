                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <p>In the spring of 2022, Anette and Clari, two emerging entrepreneurs, formed a fated 
                  bond at a Miami market. Despite their differences, their friendship deepened over time, 
                  evolving into an opportunity for something greater than themselves.</p>
                <p>Their shared dreams and mutual support became the catalyst for the creation of Pana 
                  MIA Club, proving that entrepreneurship doesn't have to be a solo journey. Together, 
                  they discovered the power of unity among local entrepreneurs and creatives. Pana MIA's 
                  story began in that unexpected meeting that transformed into the foundation of it all.</p>

                  <h3>Anette Mago, Co-Founder</h3>
                  <p>Anette Mago, a Venezuelan-American conceptual artist raised in South Florida, has long 
                    been fascinated by the multicultural landscape and vibrant community of her home state. 
                    Having graduated from the University of Florida in Visual Art Studies in 2021, she delved 
                    into the Miami art scene while establishing her artwear brand, Alobebi. Two years into her 
                    entrepreneurial journey, Anette formed a close bond with Claribel, another small business 
                    owner. Recognizing the importance of a supportive community, Anette's realization led to 
                    the creation of Pana MIA Club, her most ambitious art project to date.</p>

                  <h3>Claribel Avila, Co-Founder</h3>
                  <p>Claribel Avila is a Puerto Rican entrepreneur and creative who began calling Miami home 
                    in 2021. They graduated from Northeastern University in 2018 with a Bachelors in Economic 
                    Policy. Having been raised by an entrepreneurial migrant family, they explored diverse 
                    industries and started their first business in 2019, selling herbal-infused honey. Despite 
                    their many passions and personal pursuits, their central focus has always been social, 
                    economic and racial justice. Moving to Miami brought purpose, and as a problem solver, 
                    their work with Pana MIA Club soon became a way to leverage strengths in order to bring 
                    about a more equitable and humane world.</p>
